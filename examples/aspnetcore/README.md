# Honeycomb.OpenTelemetry ASP.NET Core web example

This example shows how to use the Honeycomb.OpenTelemetry distro with a .NET Core web application.

To run the example, you need to set your Honeycomb API key and a dataset name in [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) configuration file then run your app. 

As part of the configuration process, an instance of the Tracer is registed in the services Dependency Injection map that can be be injected into controllers and used to add additional context and create additional spans.

### Example

See [Startup.cs](Startup.cs) for an example of how the `AddHoneycomb` method is called and [WeatherForecastController](Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs) for an example.
